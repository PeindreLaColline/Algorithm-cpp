1. 알고스팟1
  Tried to solve it for 4 days and I failed

2. 알고스팟2
  So I found a solution from the link down below
    https://chanhuiseok.github.io/posts/baek-17/
  And it did work but I don't see that big difference compare to mine (알고스팟1)

3. 알고스팟3
  So I tried again to find and solve the problem from 알고스팟1
  Found the reason from the link down below
    https://discuss.codechef.com/t/comparators-in-priority-queue-in-cpp/94291/2
  The problem was that I didn't declare proper operator for prioirity_queue
  It was not about my logic
  So I modified the operator function, and kept my original logic(알고스팟1)
  It worked

In short,
logic was fine at the first place but the grammer was bad
