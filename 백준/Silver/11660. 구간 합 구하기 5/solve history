mainly, logic was correct but method was slow
for example, push_back in vector or cout<<endl;

To solve,
1. push_back 
  -> initialize the board instead of add the value everytime
  -> it's because push_back causes resizing and it takes long time

2. cout<<endl;
  -> take long time
  -> better to use '\n'
  -> anyway it's same

3. add these codes
  -> ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	-> cin.tie(0);
 -> it's about a relationship between cin and printf
 -> if only one method is used, try to add those codes
 -> it will make it faster

In brief,
It was all about the way getting the input and print
not about algorithm
